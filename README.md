Why did you pick this API topic?

I picked this API topic because I wanted to do something different that I did not have so much knowledge in. I did this on purpose because I wanted to learn the different breeds there are and there personality, origin, and if they are hypoallergenic.

How was your experience building your own API server after using other APIs as a client in Unit 2?

My experience building on making my own API server after using APIs as a cliend in Unit 2 has been very knowledgeable because these APIs help give me a understanding on how they work.
